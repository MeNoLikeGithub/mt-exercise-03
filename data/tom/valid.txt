He read the letter once , and then over again , and when he had finished it a second time , he made a dash for the house .
&quot; I say dad ! &quot;
cried Tom .
&quot; This is great !
Great news here !
Where are you , dad ?
Say , Mrs. Baggert , &quot; he called as he saw the motherly housekeeper , &quot; where &apos;s father ?
I &apos;ve got great news for him ?
Where is he ? &quot;
&quot; Out in the shop , I think .
I believe Mr. Damon is with him . &quot;
&quot; And blessing everything as usual , from his hat to his shoe laces , I &apos;ll wager , &quot; murmured Tom as he made his way to the shop where his father , also an inventor like himself , spent much of his time .
&quot; Well , well , I &apos;m glad Mr. Damon is here , for he &apos;ll be interested in this . &quot;
Tom fairly rushed into the building , much of the space of which , was taken up by machinery , queer tools and odd devices , many of them having to do with the manufacture of aeroplanes , for Tom had as many of them as some people have of automobiles .
&quot; I say , dad ! &quot;
cried Tom , waving the letter above his head , &quot; what do you think of this ?
Listen to-- &quot; &quot; Easy there now , Tom !
Easy , my boy , or you &apos;ll oblige me to do all my work over again , &quot; and an aged man , beside whom a younger one was standing , held up a hand of caution , while with the other hand he was adjusting some delicate piece of machinery .
&quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
demanded the son .
&quot; Bless my scarf pin ! &quot;
exclaimed the other man--Mr . Wakefield Damon-- &quot; Bless my rubbers , Tom Swift !
What SHOULD your father be doing but inventing something new , as he always is .
I guess he &apos;s working on his new gyroscope , though it is only a guess , for he hasn &apos;t said ten words to me since I came out to talk to him .
But that &apos;s like all inventors , they-- &quot; &quot; I beg your pardon , Mr. Damon , &quot; spoke Mr.
Swift with a smile , &quot; I &apos;m sure-- &quot; &quot; Say , can &apos;t you listen to me for five minutes ? &quot;
pleaded Tom .
&quot; I &apos;ve got some great news--simply great , and your gyroscope can wait , dad .
Listen to this letter , &quot; and he prepared to read it .
&quot; Who &apos;s it from ? &quot;
asked Mr. Damon .
&quot; Mr. Jacob Illingway , the African missionary whom you and I rescued , together with his wife , from the red pygmies ! &quot;
cried Tom .
&quot; Think of that !
Of all persons to get a letter from , and SUCH a letter !
SUCH news in it .
Why , it &apos;s simply great !
You remember Mr. and Mrs. Illingway ; don &apos;t you Mr. Damon ?
How we went to Africa after elephant &apos;s tusks , with Mr. Durban the hunter , and how we got the missionaries away from those little savages in my airship--don &apos;t you remember ? &quot;
&quot; I should say I did ! &quot;
exclaimed Mr. Damon .
&quot; Bless my watch chain--but they were regular imps--the red Pygmies I mean , not the missionaries .
But what is Mr. Illingway writing to you about now , Tom ?
I know he sent you several letters since we came back from Africa .
What &apos;s the latest news ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; replied the young inventor , sitting down on a packing box .
&quot; It would take too long to read the letter so I &apos;ll sum it up , and you can go over it later . &quot;
&quot; To be brief , Mr. Illingway tells of a wonderful golden image that is worshiped by a tribe of Africans in a settlement not far from Gumba Twamba , where he is stationed .
It &apos;s an image of solid gold-- &quot; &quot; Solid gold ! &quot;
interrupted Mr.
Swift .
&quot; Yes , dad , and about three feet high , &quot; went on Tom , referring to the letter to make sure .
&quot; It &apos;s heavy , too , no hollows in it , and these Africans regard it as a god .
But that &apos;s not the strangest part of it .
Mr. Illingway goes on to say that there is no gold in that part of Africa , and for a time he was at a loss how to account for the golden image .
He made some inquiries and learned that it was once the property of a white traveler who made his home with the tribe that now worships the image of gold .
This traveler , whose name Mr. Illingway could not find out , was much liked by the Africans .
He taught them many things , doctored them when they were sick , and they finally adopted him into the tribe . &quot;
&quot; It seems that he tried to make them better , and wanted them to become Christians , but they clung to their own beliefs until he died .
Then , probably thinking to do his memory honor , they took the golden image , which was among his possessions , and set it up as a god . &quot;
&quot; Bless my hymn book ! &quot;
exclaimed Mr. Damon .
&quot; What did they do that for ? &quot;
&quot; This white man thought a great deal of the image , &quot; said Tom , again referring to the letter , &quot; and the Africans very likely imagined that , as he was so good to them , some of his virtues had passed into the gold .
Then , too , they may have thought it was part of his religion , and as he had so often wanted them to adopt his beliefs , they reasoned out that they could now do so , by worshiping the golden god . &quot;
&quot; Anyhow , that &apos;s what they did , and the image is there to-day , in that far-off African village .
But I haven &apos;t got to the real news yet .
The image of solid gold is only a part of it . &quot;
&quot; Before this traveler died he told some of the more intelligent natives that the image had come from a far-off underground city--a regular city of gold--nearly everything in it that was capable of being made of metal , being constructed of the precious yellow gold .
The golden image was only one of a lot more like it , some smaller and some larger-- &quot; &quot; Not larger , Tom , not larger , surely ! &quot;
interrupted Mr.
Swift .
&quot; Why , my boy , think of it !
An image of solid gold , bigger even than this one Mr. Illingway writes of , which he says is three feet high .
Why , if there are any larger they must be nearly life size , and think of a solid gold statue as large as a man--it would weigh--well , I &apos;m afraid , to say how much , and be worth--why , Tom , it &apos;s impossible .
It would be worth millions--all the wealth of a world must be in the underground city .
It &apos;s impossible Tom , my boy ! &quot;
&quot; Well , that may be , &quot; agreed Tom .
&quot; I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s true .
Mr. Illingway is telling only what he heard . &quot;
&quot; Go on !
Tell some more , &quot; begged Mr. Damon .
&quot; Bless my shirt studs , this is getting exciting ! &quot;
&quot; He says that the traveler told of this underground city of gold , &quot; went on Tom , &quot; though he had never been there himself .
He had met a native who had located it , and who had brought out some of the gold , including several of the images , and one he gave to the white man in return for some favor .
The white man took it to Africa with him . &quot;
&quot; But where is this underground city , Tom ? &quot;
asked Mr.
Swift .
&quot; Doesn &apos;t Mr. Illingway give you any idea of its location . &quot;
&quot; He says it is somewhere in Mexico , &quot; explained the lad .
&quot; The Africans haven &apos;t a very good idea of geography , but some of the tribesmen whom the white traveler taught , could draw rude maps , and Mr. Illingway had a native sketch one for him , showing as nearly as possible where the city of gold is located . &quot;
&quot; Tom Swift , have you got that map ? &quot;
suddenly cried Mr. Damon .
&quot; Bless my pocketbook , but-- &quot; &quot; I have it ! &quot;
said Tom quietly , taking from the envelope a piece of paper covered with rough marks .
&quot; It isn &apos;t very good , but-- &quot; &quot; Bless my very existence ! &quot;
cried the excitable man .
&quot; But you &apos;re not going to let such a chance as this slip past ; are you Tom ?
Are you going to hunt for that buried city of gold ? &quot;
&quot; I certainly am , &quot; answered the young inventor quietly .
&quot; Tom !
You &apos;re not going off on another wild expedition ? &quot;
asked Mr.
Swift anxiously .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ll have to , &quot; answered his son with a smile .
&quot; Go ?
Of course he &apos;ll go ! &quot;
burst out Mr. Damon .
&quot; And I &apos;m going with him ; can &apos;t I , Tom ? &quot;
&quot; Surely .
The reason Mr. Illingway sent me the letter was to tell me about the city of gold .
He thought , after my travels in Africa , that to find a buried city in Mexico would be no trouble at all , I suppose .
Anyhow he suggests that I make the attempt , and-- &quot; &quot; Oh , but , Tom , just when I am perfecting my gyroscope ! &quot;
exclaimed Mr.
Swift .
&quot; I need your help . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll help you when I come back , dad .
I want to get some of this gold . &quot;
&quot; But we are rich enough , Tom . &quot;
&quot; It isn &apos;t so much the money , dad .
Listen .
There is another part to the letter .
Mr. Illingway says that in that underground city , according to the rumor among the African natives , there is not only gold in plenty , and a number of small gold statues , but one immense big one--of solid gold , as large as three men , and there is some queer mystery about it , so that white traveler said .
A mystery he wanted to solve but could not . &quot;
&quot; So , dad , I &apos;m going to search for that underground city , not only for the mere gold , but to see if I can solve the mystery of the big gold statue .
And if I could bring it away , &quot; cried Tom in great excitement as he waved the missionary &apos;s letter above his head , &quot; it would be one of the wonders of the world--dad , for , not only is it very valuable , but it is most beautifully carved . &quot;
&quot; Well , I might as well give up my gyroscope work until you come back from the city of gold , Tom , I can see that , &quot; said Mr.
Swift , with a faint smile .
&quot; And if you go , I hope you come back .
I don &apos;t want that mysterious image to be the undoing of you . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I &apos;ll come back all right ! &quot;
cried Tom confidently .
&quot; Ho !
for the city of gold and the images thereof !
I &apos;m going to get ready to start ! &quot;
&quot; And so am I ! &quot;
cried Mr. Damon .
&quot; Bless my shoe strings , Tom , but I &apos;m with you !
I certainly am ! &quot;
and the little man excitedly shook hands with Tom Swift , while the aged inventor looked on and nodded his head doubtfully .
But Tom was full of hope .
CHAPTER II AN UNSUSPECTED LISTENER For a few moments after Tom Swift had announced his decision to start for the city of gold , and Mr. Damon had said he would accompany the young inventor , there was a silence in the workshop .
Then Mr.
Swift laid aside the delicate mechanism of the new model gyroscope on which he had been working , came over to his son , and said : &quot; Well , Tom , if you &apos;re going , that means you &apos;re going--I know enough to predict that .
I rather wish you weren &apos;t , for I &apos;m afraid no good will come of this . &quot;
&quot; Now , dad , don &apos;t be talking that way ! &quot;
cried Tom gaily .
&quot; Pack up and come along with us . &quot;
Lovingly he placed his arm around the bent shoulders of his father .
&quot; No , Tom , I &apos;m too old .
Home is the place for me . &quot;
&quot; Bless my arithmetic tables ! &quot;
exclaimed Mr. Damon , &quot; you &apos;re not so much older than I am , and I &apos;m going with Tom .
Come on , Mr.
Swift . &quot;
&quot; No , I can &apos;t put up with dangers , hardship and excitement as I used to .
I &apos;d better stay home .
Besides , I want to perfect my new gyroscope .
I &apos;ll work on that while you and Tom are searching for the city of gold .
But , Tom , if you &apos;re going you &apos;d better have something more definite to look for than an unknown city , located on a map drawn by some African bushman . &quot;
&quot; I intend to , dad .
I guess when Mr. Illingway wrote his letter he didn &apos;t really think I &apos;d take him up , and make the search .
I &apos;m going to write and ask him if he can &apos;t get me a better map , and also learn more about the location of the city .
Mexico isn &apos;t such a very large place , but it would be if you had to hunt all over it for a buried city , and this map isn &apos;t a lot of help , &quot; and Tom who had shown it to his father and Mr. Damon looked at it closely .
&quot; If we &apos;re going , we want all the information we can get , &quot; declared the odd man .
&quot; Bless my gizzard , Tom , but this may mean a lot to us ! &quot;
&quot; I think it will , &quot; agreed the young inventor .
&quot; I &apos;m going to write to Mr. Illingway at once , and ask for all the information he can get . &quot;
&quot; And I &apos;ll help you with suggestions , &quot; spoke Mr. Damon .
&quot; Come on in the house , Tom .
Bless my ink bottle , but we &apos;re going to have some adventures again ! &quot;
&quot; It seems to me that is about all Tom does--have adventures--that and invent flying machines , &quot; said Mr.
Swift with a smile , as his son and their visitor left the shop .
Then he once more bent over his gyroscope model , while Tom and Mr. Damon hurried in to write the letter to the African missionary .
And while this is being done I am going to ask your patience for a little while--my old readers , I mean--while I tell my new friends , who have never yet met Tom Swift , something about him .
Mr.
Swift spoke truly when he said his son seemed to do nothing but seek adventures and invent flying machines .
Of the latter the lad had a goodly number , some of which involved new and startling ideas .
For Tom was a lad who &quot; did things . &quot;
In the first volume of this series , entitled &quot; Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle , &quot; I told you how he became acquainted with Mr. Damon .
That eccentric individual was riding a motor cycle , when it started to climb a tree .
Mr. Damon was thrown off in front of Tom &apos;s house , somewhat hurt , and the young inventor took him in .
Tom and his father lived in the village of Shopton , New York , and Mr.
Swift was an inventor of note .
His son followed in his footsteps .
Mrs.
Swift had been dead some years , and they had a good housekeeper , Mrs. Baggert .
Another &quot; member &quot; of the family was Eradicate Sampson , a colored man of all work , who said he was named &quot; Eradicate &quot; because he &quot; eradicated &quot; the dirt .
He used to do odd jobs of whitewashing before he was regularly employed by Mr.
Swift as a sort of gardener and watchman .
In the first book I told how Tom bought the motor cycle from Mr. Damon , fixed it up , and had many adventures on it , not the least of which was saving some valuable patent models of his father &apos;s which some thieves had taken .
Then Tom Swift got a motor boat , as related in the second volume of the series , and he had many exciting trips in that craft .
Following that he made his first airship with the help of a veteran balloonist and then , not satisfied with adventures in the air , he and his father perfected a wonderful submarine boat in which they went under the ocean for sunken treasure .
The automobile industry was fast forging to the front when Tom came back from his trip under water , and naturally he turned his attention to that .
But he made an electric car instead of one that was operated by gasolene , and it proved to be the speediest car on the road .
The details of Tom Swift and his wireless message will be found in the book of that title .
It tells how he saved the castaways of Earthquake Island , and among them was Mr. Nestor , the father of Mary , a girl whom Tom thought--but there , I &apos;m not going to be mean , and tell on a good fellow .
You can guess what I &apos;m hinting at , I think .
It was when Tom went to get Mary Nestor a diamond ring that he fell in with Mr. Barcoe Jenks , who eventually took Tom off on a search for the diamond makers , and he and Tom , with some friends , discovered the secret of Phantom Mountain .
One would have thought that these adventures would have been enough for Tom Swift , but , like Alexander , he sighed for new worlds to conquer .
How he went to the caves of ice in search of treasure , and how his airship was wrecked is told in the eighth volume of the series , and in the next is related the details of his swift sky-racer , in which he and Mr. Damon made a wonderfully fast trip , and brought a doctor to Mr.
Swift in time to save the life of the aged inventor .
It was when Tom invented a wonderful electric rifle , and went to Africa with a Mr. Durban , a great hunter , to get elephants &apos; tusks , that he rescued Mr. and Mrs. Illingway , the missionaries , who were held captive by red pygmies .
That was a startling trip , and full of surprises .
Tom took with him to the dark continent a new airship , the Black Hawk , and but for this he and his friends never would have escaped from the savages and the wild beasts .
As it was , they had a hazardous time getting the missionary and his wife away from the jungle .
It was this same missionary who , as told in the first chapter of this book , sent Tom the letter about the city of gold .
Mr. Illingway and his wife wanted to stay in Africa in an endeavor to christianize the natives , even after their terrible experience .
So Tom landed them at a white settlement .
It was from there that the letter came .
But the missionaries were not the only ones whom Tom saved from the red pygmies .
Andy Foger , a Shopton youth , was Tom &apos;s enemy , and he had interfered with our hero &apos;s plans in his trips .
He even had an airship made , and followed Tom to Africa .
There Andy Foger and his companion , a German were captured by the savages .
But though Tom saved his life , Andy did not seem to give over annoying the young inventor .
Andy was born mean , and , as Eradicate Sampson used to say , &quot; dat meanness neber will done git whitewashed outer him--dat &apos;s a fack ! &quot;
But if Andy Foger was mean to Tom , there was another Shopton lad who was just the reverse .
This was Ned Newton , who was Tom &apos;s particular chum , Ned had gone with our hero on many trips , including the one to Africa after elephants .
Mr. Damon also accompanied Tom many times , and occasionally Eradicate went along on the shorter voyages .
But Eradicate was getting old , like Mr.
Swift , who , of late years , had not traveled much with his son .
When I add that Tom still continued to invent things , that he was always looking for new adventures , that he still cared very much for Mary Nestor , and thought his father the best in the world , and liked Mr. Damon and Ned Newton above all his other acquaintances , except perhaps Mrs. Baggert , the housekeeper , I think perhaps I have said enough about him ; and now I will get back to the story .
I might add , however , that Andy Foger , who had been away from Shopton for some time , had now returned to the village , and had lately been seen by Tom , riding around in a powerful auto .
The sight of Andy did not make the young inventor feel any happier .
&quot; Well , Tom , I think that will do , &quot; remarked Mr. Damon when , after about an hour &apos;s work , they had jointly written a letter to the African missionary .
&quot; We &apos;ve asked him enough questions , anyhow , &quot; agreed the lad .
&quot; If he answers all of them we &apos;ll know more about the city of gold , and where it is , than we do now . &quot;
&quot; Exactly , &quot; spoke the odd man .
&quot; Now to mail the letter , and wait for an answer .
It will take several weeks , for they don &apos;t have good mail service to that part of Africa .
I hope Mr. Illingway sends us a better map . &quot;
&quot; So do I , &quot; assented Tom .
&quot; But even with the one we have I &apos;d take a chance and look for the underground city . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll mail the letter , &quot; went on Mr. Damon , who was as eager over the prospective adventure as was Tom .
&quot; I &apos;m going back home to Waterfield I think .
My wife says I stay here too much . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t be in a hurry , &quot; urged Tom .
&quot; Can &apos;t you stay to supper ?
I &apos;ll take you home to-night in the sky racer .
I want to talk more about the city of gold , and plan what we ought to take with us to Mexico . &quot;
&quot; All right , &quot; agreed Mr. Damon .
&quot; I &apos;ll stay , but I suppose I shouldn &apos;t .
But let &apos;s mail the letter . &quot;
It was after supper , when , the letter having been posted , that Tom , his father and Mr. Damon were discussing the city of gold .
&quot; Will you go , even if Mr. Illingway can &apos;t send a better map ? &quot;
asked Mr. Damon .
&quot; Sure , &quot; exclaimed Tom .
&quot; I want to get one of the golden images if I have to hunt all over the Aztec country for it . &quot;
&quot; Who &apos;s talking of golden images ? &quot;
demanded a new voice , and Tom looked up quickly , to see Ned Newton , his chum , entering the room .
Ned had come in unannounced , as he frequently did .
&quot; Hello , old stock ! &quot;
cried Tom affectionately .
&quot; Sir , there &apos;s great news .
It &apos;s you and me for the city of gold now ! &quot;
&quot; Get out !
What are you talking about ? &quot;
Then Tom had to go into details , and explain to Ned all about the great quantity of gold that might be found in the underground city .
&quot; You &apos;ll come along , won &apos;t you , Ned ? &quot;
finished the young inventor .
&quot; We can &apos;t get along without you .
Mr. Damon is going , and Eradicate too , I guess .
We &apos;ll have a great time . &quot;
&quot; Well , maybe I can fix it so I can go , &quot; agreed Ned , slowly , &quot; I &apos;d like it , above all things .
Where did you say that golden city was ? &quot;
&quot; Somewhere about the central part of Mexico , near the city of-- &quot; &quot; Hark ! &quot;
suddenly exclaimed Ned , holding up a hand to caution Tom to silence .
&quot; What is it ? &quot;
asked the young inventor in a whisper .
&quot; Some one is coming along the hall , &quot; replied Ned in a low voice .
They all listened intently .
There was no doubt but that some one was approaching along the corridor leading to the library where the conference was being held .
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s only Mrs. Baggert , &quot; remarked Tom a moment later , relief showing in his voice .
&quot; I know her step . &quot;
There was a tap on the door , and the housekeeper pushed it open , for it had been left ajar .
She thrust her head in and remarked : &quot; I guess you &apos;ve forgotten , Mr.
Swift , that Andy Foger is waiting for you in the next room .
He has a letter for you . &quot;
&quot; Andy Foger ! &quot;
gasped Tom .
&quot; Here . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s so , I forgot all about him ! &quot;
exclaimed Mr.
Swift jumping up .
&quot; It slipped my mind .
I let him in a while ago , before we came in the library , and he &apos;s probably been sitting in the parlor ever since .
I thought he wanted to see you , Tom , so I told him to wait .
And I forgot all about him .
You &apos;d better see what he wants . &quot;
&quot; Andy Foger there--in the next room , &quot; murmured Tom .
&quot; He &apos;s been there some time .
I wonder how much he heard about the city of gold ? &quot;
CHAPTER III ANDY IS WHITEWASHED The parlor where Mr.
Swift had asked Andy to wait , adjoined the library , and there was a connecting door , over which heavy curtains were draped .
Tom quickly pulled them aside and stepped into the parlor .
The connecting door had been open slightly , and in a flash the young inventor realized that it was perfectly possible for any one in the next room to have heard most of the talk about the city of gold .
A glance across the room showed Andy seated on the far side , apparently engaged in reading a book .
&quot; Did you want to see me ? &quot;
asked Tom sharply .
His father and the others in the library listened intently .
Tom wondered what in the world Andy could want of him , since the two were never in good tame , and Andy cherished a resentment even since our hero had rescued him from the African jungle .
&quot; No , I didn &apos;t come to see you , &quot; answered Andy quickly , laying aside the book and rising to face Tom .
&quot; Then what-- &quot; &quot; I came to see your father , &quot; interrupted the red-haired bully .
&quot; I have a letter for him from my father ; but I guess Mr.
Swift misunderstood me when he let me in . &quot;
&quot; Did you tell him you wanted to see me ? &quot;
asked Tom suspiciously , thinking Andy had made a mistatement in order to have a longer time to wait .
&quot; No , I didn &apos;t , but I guess your father must have been thinking about something else , for he told me to come in here and sit down .
I &apos;ve been waiting ever since , and just now Mrs. Baggert passed and saw me .
She-- &quot; &quot; Yes , she said you were here , &quot; spoke Tom significantly .
&quot; Well , then it &apos;s my father you want to see .
I &apos;ll tell him . &quot;
Tom hurried back to the library .
&quot; Dad , &quot; he said , &quot; it &apos;s you that Andy wants to see .
He has a letter from Mr. Foger for you . &quot;
&quot; For me ?
What in the world can it be about ?
He never wrote to me before .
I must have misunderstood Andy .
But then it &apos;s no wonder for my head is so full of my new gyroscope plans .
There is a certain spring I can &apos;t seem to get right-- &quot; &quot; Perhaps you &apos;d better see what Andy wants , &quot; suggested Mr. Damon gently .
He looked at Tom .
They were both thinking of the same thing .
&quot; I will , &quot; replied Mr.
Swift quickly , and he passed into the library .
&quot; I wonder how much Andy heard ? &quot;
asked Ned , in a low voice .
&quot; Oh , I don &apos;t believe it could have been very much , &quot; answered Tom .
&quot; No , I stopped you just in time , &quot; rejoined his chum , &quot; or you might have blurted out the name of the city near where the buried gold is . &quot;
&quot; Yes , we must guard our secret well , Tom , &quot; put in Mr. Damon .
&quot; Well , Andy couldn &apos;t have known anything about the letter I got , &quot; declared Tom , &quot; and if he only heard snatches of our talk it won &apos;t do him much good . &quot;
&quot; The only trouble is he &apos;s been there long enough to have heard most of it . &quot;
suggested Ned .
They could talk freely now , for in going into the parlor Mr.
Swift had tightly closed the door after him .
They could just hear the murmur of his voice speaking to Andy .
&quot; Well , even if he does guess about the city of gold , and its location , I don &apos;t believe he &apos;ll try to go there , &quot; remarked Tom , after a pause .
A moment later they heard Mr.
Swift letting Andy out of the front door , and then the inventor rejoined his son and the others .
He held an open letter in his hand .
&quot; This is strange--very strange , &quot; he murmured .
&quot; What is it ? &quot;
asked Tom quickly .
&quot; Why , Mr. Foger has written to me asking to be allowed to sell some of our patents and machines on commission . &quot;
&quot; Sell them on commission ! &quot;
exclaimed his son .
&quot; Why does a millionaire like Mr. Foger want to be selling goods on commission ?
It &apos;s only a trick ! &quot;
&quot; No , it &apos;s not a trick , &quot; said Mr.
Swift slowly .
&quot; He is in earnest .
Tom , Mr. Foger has lost his millions .
His fortune has been swept away by unfortunate investments , he tells me , and he would be glad of any work I could give him .
That &apos;s why Andy brought the letter to-night .
I just sent him back with an answer . &quot;
&quot; What did you say , dad ? &quot;
&quot; I said I &apos;d think it over . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Foger &apos;s millions gone , &quot; mused Tom .
&quot; And Andy in there listening to what we said about the city of gold , &quot; added Ned .
&quot; No wonder he was glad the door was open .
He &apos;d be there in a minute , Tom , if he could , and so would Mr. Foger , if he thought he could get rich .
He wouldn &apos;t have to sell goods on commission if he could pick up a few of the golden images . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; agreed Tom , with an uneasy air .
&quot; I wish I knew just how much Andy had heard .
But perhaps it wasn &apos;t much . &quot;
The time was to come , however , when Tom was to learn to his sorrow that Andy Foger had overheard a great deal .
&quot; Bless my bankbook ! &quot;
exclaimed Mr. Damon .
&quot; I never dreamed of such a thing !
Andy had every reason in the world for not wanting us to know he was in there !
No wonder he kept quiet .
I &apos;ll wager all the while he was as close to the open door as he could get , hoping to overhear about the location of the place , so he could help his father get back his lost fortune .
Bless my hatband !
It &apos;s a good thing Mrs. Baggert told us he was there . &quot;
They all agreed with this , and then , as there was no further danger of being overheard , they resumed their talk about the city of gold .
It was decided that they would have to wait the arrival of another letter from Mr. Illingway before starting for Mexico .
&quot; Well , as long as that much is settled , I think I &apos;d better be going home , &quot; suggested Mr. Damon .
&quot; I know my wife will be anxious about me . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll get out the sky racer and you &apos;ll be in Waterford in a jiffy , &quot; said Tom , and he kept his word , for the speedy aeroplane carried him and his guest rapidly through the night , bringing Tom safely back home .
It was several days after this , during which time Tom and Ned had had many talks about the proposed trip .
They had figured on what sort of a craft to use in the journey .
Tom had about decided on a small , but very powerful , dirigible balloon , that could be packed in a small compass and taken along .
&quot; This city may be in some mountain valley , and a balloon will be the only way we can get to it , &quot; he told Ned .
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; agreed his chum .
&quot; By the way , you haven &apos;t heard any more about Andy ; have you ? &quot;
&quot; Not a thing .
Haven &apos;t even seen him .
None of us have . &quot;
&quot; There goes Rad , I wonder if he &apos;s seen him . &quot;
&quot; No , or he &apos;d have mentioned it to me .
Hey , Rad , &quot; Tom called to the colored man , &quot; what are you going to do ? &quot;
&quot; Whitewash de back fence , Massa Tom .
It &apos;s in a mos &apos; disrupted state ob disgrace .
I &apos;se jest natchally got t &apos; whitewash it . &quot;
&quot; All right , Rad , and when you get through come back here .
I &apos;ve got another job for you . &quot;
&quot; A &apos;right , Massa Tom , I shorely will , &quot; and Rad limped off with his pail of whitewash , and the long-handled brush .
It may have been fate that sent Andy Foger along the rear road a little later , and past the place where Eradicate was making the fence less &quot; disrupted . &quot;
It may have been fate or Andy may have just been sneaking along to see if he could overhear anything of Tom &apos;s plans--a trick of which he was frequently guilty .
