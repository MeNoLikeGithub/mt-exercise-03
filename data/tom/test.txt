At any rate , Andy walked past where Eradicate was whitewashing .
The colored man saw the red-haired lad coming and murmured : &quot; Dere &apos;s dat no &apos; count white trash !
I jest wish Massa Tom was here now .
He &apos;d jest natchally wallop Andy , &quot; and Eradicate moved his longhandled brush up and down , as though he were coating the Foger lad with the white stuff .
As it happened , Eradicate was putting some of the liquid on a particularly rough spot in the fence , a spot low down , and this naturally made the handle of his brush stick out over the sidewalk , and at this moment Andy Foger got there .
&quot; Here , you black rascal ! &quot;
the lad angrily exclaimed .
&quot; What do you mean by blocking the sidewalk that way ?
It &apos;s against the law , and I could have you arrested for that . &quot;
&quot; No , could yo &apos; really now ? &quot;
asked Eradicate drawlingly for he was not afraid of Andy .
&quot; Yes , I could , and don &apos;t you give me any of your back-talk !
Get that brush out of the way ! &quot;
and Andy kicked the long handle .
The natural result followed .
The other end of the brush , wet with whitewash , described a curve through the air , coming toward the mean bully .
And as the blow of Andy &apos;s foot jarred the brush loose , the next moment it fell right on Andy &apos;s head , the white liquid trickling down on his clothes , for Eradicate was not a miser when it came to putting on whitewash .
For a moment Andy could not speak .
Then he burst out with : &quot; Hi !
You did that on purpose !
I &apos;ll have you in jail for that !
Look at my hat , it &apos;s ruined !
Look at my clothes !
They &apos;re ruined !
Oh , I &apos;ll make you pay for this ! &quot;
&quot; Deed , it shore was a accident , &quot; said Eradicate , trying not to laugh .
&quot; You done did it yo &apos;se &apos;f ! &quot;
&quot; I did not !
You did it on purpose ; Tom Swift put you in on this !
I &apos;ll--I &apos;ll-- &quot; But Andy had to stop and splutter for some of the lime ran down off his hat into his mouth , and he yelled : &quot; I &apos;ll--I &apos;ll--Ouch !
Phew !
Woof !
Oof !
Oh ! &quot;
Then , in his rage , he made a blind rush for Eradicate .
Now the colored man had no fear of Andy , but he did not want the pail of whitewash to upset , and the said pail was right in the path of the advancing youth .
&quot; Look out ! &quot;
cried Eradicate .
&quot; I &apos;ll make you look out ! &quot;
spluttered Andy .
&quot; I &apos;ll thrash you for this ! &quot;
Eradicate caught up his pail .
He did not want to have the trouble of mixing more of the liquid .
Just as he lifted it Andy aimed a kick for him .
But he mis-calculated , and his foot struck the bottom of the pail and sent it flying from the hands of the colored man .
Sent it flying right toward Andy himself , for Eradicate jumped back out of the way .
And the next moment a veritable deluge of whitewash was sprayed and splashed and splattered over Andy , covering him with the snowy liquid from head to foot !
CHAPTER IV A PERILOUS FLIGHT There was silence for a moment--there had to be--for Eradicate was doubled over with mirth and could not even laugh aloud , and as for Andy the whitewash running down his face and over his mouth effectually prevented speech .
But the silence did not last long .
Just as Eradicate caught his breath , and let out a hearty laugh , Andy succeeded in wiping some of the liquid from his face so that it was safe to open his mouth .
Then he fairly let out a roar of rage .
&quot; I &apos;ll have you put in jail for that , Eradicate Sampson ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; You &apos;ve nearly killed me : You &apos;ll suffer for this !
My father will sue you for damages , too !
Look at me !
Look at me ! &quot;
&quot; Dat &apos;s jest what I &apos;se doin &apos; , honey !
Jest what I &apos;se doin &apos; ! &quot;
gasped Eradicate , hardly able to speak from laughter .
&quot; Yo &apos; suah am a most contrary lookin &apos; specimen !
Yo &apos; suah is !
Ha !
Ha ! &quot;
&quot; Stop it ! &quot;
commanded Andy .
&quot; Don &apos;t you dare laugh at me , after throwing whitewash on me . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t throw no whitewash on you ! &quot;
protested the colored man .
&quot; Yo &apos; done poured it over yo &apos;se &apos;f , dat &apos;s what yo &apos; done did .
An &apos; I jest cain &apos;t help laughin &apos; , honey .
I jest natchally cain &apos;t !
Yo &apos; look so mortally distressed , dat &apos;s what yo &apos; does ! &quot;
Andy &apos;s rage might have been dangerous , but the very excess of it rendered him incapable of doing anything .
He was wild at Eradicate and would willingly have attacked him , but the whitewash was beginning to soak through his clothes , and he was so wet and miserable that soon all the fight oozed out of him .
Then , too , though Eradicate was old , he was strong and he still held the long handle of the whitewash brush , no unformidable weapon .
So Andy contented himself with verbal abuse .
He called Eradicate all the mean names he could think of , ending up with : &quot; You won &apos;t hear the last of this for a long time , either .
I &apos;ll have you , and your old rack of bones , your mule Boomerang , run out of town , that &apos;s what I will . &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s dat ?
Yo &apos; all gwine t &apos;hab Boomerang run out ob town ? &quot;
demanded Eradicate , a sudden change coming over him .
His mule was his most beloved possession .
&quot; Lemme tell yo &apos; one thing , Massa Andy .
I &apos;se an old colored man , an &apos; I ain &apos;t much &apos; count mebby .
But ef yo &apos; dare lay one finger on mah mule Boomerang , only jest one finger , mind you &apos; , why I &apos;ll--I &apos;ll jest natchally drown yo &apos; --all in whitewash , dat &apos;s what I &apos;ll do ! &quot;
Eradicate drew himself up proudly , and boldly faced Andy .
The bully shrank back .
He knew better than to arouse the colored man further .
&quot; You &apos;ll suffer for this , &quot; predicted the bully .
&quot; I &apos;m not going to forget it .
Tom Swift put you up to this , and I &apos;ll take it out of him the next time I see him .
He &apos;s to blame . &quot;
&quot; Now looky heah , honey ! &quot;
said Eradicate quick .
&quot; Doan &apos;t yo &apos; all git no sich notion laik dat in yo &apos; head .
Massa Tom didn &apos;t tell me to do noth &apos;in an I ain &apos;t .
He ain &apos;t eben &apos; round yeh .
An &apos; annudder thing .
Yo &apos;se t &apos; blame to &apos; this yo &apos; own se &apos;f .
Ef yo &apos; hadn &apos;t gone fo &apos; is kick de bucket it nebber would &apos; a happened .
It &apos;s yo &apos; own fault , honey , an &apos; doan &apos;t yo &apos; forgit dat !
No , yo &apos; better go home an &apos; git some dry clothes on . &quot;
It was good advice , for Andy was soaking wet .
He glared angrily at Eradicate , and then swung off down the road , the whitewash dripping from his garments at every step .
&quot; Land a massy !
But he suah did use up all mah lime . &quot;
complained Eradicate , as he picked up the overturned pail .
&quot; I &apos;s got t &apos; make mo &apos; .
But I doan &apos;t mind , &quot; he added cheerfully , and then , as he saw the woe-begone figure of Andy shuffling along , he laughed heartily , fitted the brush on the handle and went to tell Tom and Ned what had happened , and make more whitewash .
&quot; Hum !
Served him right , &quot; commented the young inventor .
&quot; I suppose he &apos;ll try to play some mean trick on you now , &quot; commented Ned .
&quot; He &apos;ll think you had some hand in what Rad did . &quot;
&quot; Let him , &quot; answered Tom .
&quot; If he tries any of his games I &apos;ll be ready for him . &quot;
&quot; Maybe we &apos;ll soon be able to start for the city of gold , &quot; suggested Ned .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid not in some time , &quot; was his chum &apos;s reply .
&quot; It &apos;s going to take quite a while to get ready , and then we &apos;ve got to wait to hear from Mr. Illingway .
I wonder if it &apos;s true that Mr. Foger has lost his fortune ; or was that only a trick ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s true enough , &quot; answered Ned .
&quot; I heard some of the bank officials talking about it the other day . &quot;
Ned was employed in one of the Shopton banks , an institution in which Tom and his father owned considerable stock .
&quot; He hasn &apos;t hardly any money left , and he may leave town and go out west , I heard . &quot;
&quot; He can &apos;t go any too soon to suit me , &quot; spoke Tom , &quot; and I hope he takes Andy with him . &quot;
&quot; Your father isn &apos;t going to have any business dealings with Mr. Foger then ? &quot;
&quot; I guess not .
Dad doesn &apos;t trust him .
But say , Ned , what do you say to a little trip in my sky racer ?
I want to go over to Waterford and see Mr. Damon .
We can talk about our trip , and he was going to get some big maps of Central Mexico to study .
Will you come ? &quot;
&quot; I will this afternoon .
I &apos;ve got to go to the bank now . &quot;
&quot; All right , I &apos;ll wait for you .
In the meanwhile I &apos;ll be tuning up the motor .
It didn &apos;t run just right the other night . &quot;
The two chums separated , Ned to go downtown to the bank , while Tom hastened to the shed where he kept his speedy little air craft .
Meanwhile Eradicate went on whitewashing the fence , pausing every now and then to chuckle at the memory of Andy Foger .
Tom found that some minor adjustments had to be made to the motor , and they took him a couple of hours to complete .
It was nearly noon when he finished , and leaving the sky racer in the open space in front of the shed , he went in the house to wash up , for his face and hands were begrimed with dirt and oil .
&quot; But the machine &apos;s in good shape , &quot; he said to the housekeeper when she objected to his appearance , &quot; and Ned and I will have a speedy spin this afternoon . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you reckless boys !
Risking your lives in those aeroplanes ! &quot;
exclaimed Mrs. Baggert .
&quot; Why , they &apos;re safer than street cars ! &quot;
declared Tom with a laugh .
&quot; Just think how often street cars collide , and you never heard of an aeroplane doing that . &quot;
&quot; No , but think what happens when they fall . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s it ! &quot;
cried Tom gaily , &quot; when they fall you don &apos;t have time to think .
But is dinner ready ?
I &apos;m hungry . &quot;
&quot; Never saw you when you weren &apos;t . &quot;
commented the housekeeper laughing .
&quot; Yes , you can sit right down .
We won &apos;t wait for your father .
He said he &apos;d be late as he wants to find something about his gyroscope .
I never did any such people as inventors for spoiling their meals , &quot; she added as she put dinner on the table .
Mr.
Swift came in before his son had finished .
&quot; Was Andy Foger here to see me again ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; No , why do you ask ? &quot;
inquired Tom quickly .
&quot; I just saw him out by the aeroplane shed , and-- &quot; Tom jumped up without another word , and hurried to where his sky racer rested on its bicycle wheels .
He breathed more easily when he saw that Andy was not in sight , and a hurried inspection of the aeroplane did not disclose that it had been tampered with .
&quot; Anything the matter ? &quot;
asked Mr.
Swift , as he followed his son .
&quot; No , but when you mentioned that Andy was out here I thought he might have been up to some of his tricks .
He had a little trouble with Eradicate this morning , and he threatened to get even with me for it . &quot;
And Tom told of the whitewashing incident .
&quot; I just happened to see him as I was coming to dinner , &quot; went on the aged inventor .
&quot; He hurried off--when he noticed me , but I thought he might have been here to leave another letter . &quot;
&quot; No , &quot; said Tom .
&quot; I must tell Eradicate to keep his weather eye open for him , though .
No telling what Andy &apos;ll do .
Well , I must finish eating , or Ned will be here before I &apos;m through . &quot;
After dinner , Ned arrived , and helped Tom start the motor .
With a roar and a bang the swift little machine rapidly got up speed , the propellers whizing so fast that they looked like blurs of light .
The sky racer was held back by a rope , as Tom wanted to note the &quot; pull &quot; of the propellers , the force they exerted against the air being registered on a spring balance .
&quot; What does it say , Ned ? &quot;
cried the young inventor as he adjusted the carburettor .
&quot; A shade over nine hundred pounds . &quot;
&quot; Guess that &apos;ll do .
Hop in , and I &apos;ll cast off from the seat . &quot;
This Tom frequently did when there was no one available to hold the aeroplane for him while he mounted .
He could pull a cord , loosen the retaining rope , and away the craft would go .
The two chums were soon seated side by side and then Tom , grasping the steering wheel , turned on full power and jerked the releasing rope .
Over the ground shot the sky racer , quickly attaining speed until , with a deft motion , the young inventor tilted the deflecting rudder and up into the air they shot .
&quot; Oh , this is glorious ! &quot;
cried Ned , for , though he had often taken trips with Tom , every time he went up he seemed to enjoy it more .
Higher and higher they rose , and then with the sharp nose of the craft turned in the proper direction they sailed off well above the trees and houses toward Waterford .
&quot; Guess I &apos;ll go up a bit higher , &quot; Tom yelled into his chums ear when they were near their destination .
&quot; Then I can make a spiral glide to earth .
I haven &apos;t practiced that lately . &quot;
Up and up went the sky racer , until it was well over the town of Waterford , where Mr. Damon lived .
&quot; There &apos;s his place ! &quot;
yelled Ned , pointing downward .
He had to yell to be heard above the noise of the motor .
Tom nodded in reply .
He , too , had picked out Mr. Damon &apos;s large estate .
There were many good landing places on it , one near the house for which Tom headed .
The aeroplane shot downward , like a bird darting from the sky .
Tom grasped the rudder lever more firmly .
He looked below him , and then , suddenly he uttered a cry of terror .
&quot; What is it ? &quot;
yelled Ned .
&quot; The rudder !
The deflecting rudder !
It &apos;s jammed , and I can &apos;t throw her head up !
We &apos;re going to smash into the ground , Ned !
I can &apos;t control her !
Something has gone wrong ! &quot;
CHAPTER V NEWS FROM AFRICA Blankly , and with fear in his eyes , Ned gazed at Tom .
The young inventor was frantically working at the levers , trying to loosen the jammed rudder--the rudder that enabled the sky racer to be tilted upward .
&quot; Can &apos;t you do it ? &quot;
cried Ned .
Tom shook his head helplessly , but he did not give up .
Madly he worked on , and there was need of haste , for every moment the aeroplane was shooting nearer and nearer to the earth .
Ned glanced down .
They were headed for the centre of a large grass plot and the bank employee found himself grimly thinking that at least the turf would be softer to fall on than bare ground .
&quot; I--I can &apos;t imagine what &apos;s happened ! &quot;
cried Tom .
He was still yanking on the lever , but it would not move , and unless the head of the aeroplane was thrown up quickly , to catch the air , and check its downward flight , they would both be killed .
&quot; Shut off the engine and vol-plane ! &quot;
cried Ned .
&quot; No use , &quot; answered Tom .
&quot; I can &apos;t vol-plane when I can &apos;t throw her head up to check her . &quot;
But he did shut off the banging , throbbing motor , and then in silence they continued to fall .
Ned had half a notion to jump , but he knew that would mean instant death , and there was just a bare chance that if he stayed in the machine it would take off some of the shock .
They could see Mr. Damon now .
The old man had run out of his house at the sight of the approaching aeroplane .
He knew it well , for he had ridden with Tom many times .
He looked up and waved his hand to the boys , but he had no idea of their danger , and he could not have helped them had he been aware of it .
He must have soon guessed that something was wrong though , for a moment later , the lads could hear him shout in terror , and could see him motion to them .
Later he said he saw that Tom was coming down at too great an inclination , and he feared that the machine could not be thrown up into the wind quickly enough !
&quot; Here goes something--the lever or the rudder ! &quot;
cried Tom in desperation , as he gave it a mighty yank .
Up to now he had not pulled with all his strength as he feared to break some connecting-rod , wire or lever .
But now he must take every chance .
&quot; If I can get that rudder up even a little we &apos;re safe ! &quot;
he went on .
Once more he gave a terrific pull on the handle .
There was a snapping sound and Tom gave a yell of delight .
&quot; That &apos;s the stuff ! &quot;
he cried .
&quot; She &apos;s moving !
We &apos;re all right now ! &quot;
And the rudder had moved only just in time , for when the aeroplane was within a hundred feet of the earth the head was suddenly elevated and she glided along on a level &quot; keel . &quot;
&quot; Look out ! &quot;
yelled Ned , for a new danger presented .
They were so near the earth that Tom had over-run his original stepping place , and now the sky racer was headed directly for Mr. Damon &apos;s house , and might crash into it .
&quot; All right !
I &apos;ve got her in hand ! &quot;
said the young inventor reassuringly .
Tom tilted the rudder at a sharp angle to have the air pressure act as a brake .
At the same time he swerved the craft to one side so that there was no longer any danger of crashing into the house .
&quot; Bless my-- &quot; began Mr. Damon , but in the excitement he really didn &apos;t know what to bless , so he stopped short .
A moment later , feeling that the momentum had been checked enough to make it safe to land , Tom directed the craft downward again and came gracefully to earth , a short distance away from his eccentric friend .
&quot; Whew ! &quot;
gasped the young inventor , as he leaped from his seat .
&quot; That was a scary time while it lasted . &quot;
&quot; I should say so ! &quot;
agreed Ned .
&quot; Bless my straw hat ! &quot;
cried Mr. Damon .
&quot; What happened ?
Did you lose control of her , Tom ? &quot;
&quot; No , the deflecting rudder got jammed , and I couldn &apos;t move it .
I must look and see what &apos;s the matter . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was all up with you , &quot; commented Mr. Damon , as he followed Tom and Ned to the front end of the craft , where the deflecting mechanism was located .
Tom glanced quickly over it .
His quick eye caught something , and he uttered an exclamation .
&quot; Look ! &quot;
the young inventor cried .
&quot; No wonder it jammed ! &quot;
and from a copper sleeve , through which ran the wire that worked the rudder , he pulled a small iron bolt .
&quot; That got between the sleeve and the wire , and I couldn &apos;t move it , &quot; he explained .
&quot; But when I pulled hard I loosened it . &quot;
&quot; How did it fall in there ? &quot;
asked Ned .
&quot; It didn &apos;t FALL there . &quot;
spoke Tom quietly .
&quot; It was PUT there . &quot;
&quot; Put there !
Bless my insurance policy !
Who did such a dastardly trick ? &quot;
cried Mr. Damon .
&quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; answered Tom still quietly , &quot; but I suspect it was Andy Foger , and he was never any nearer to putting us out of business than a little while ago , Ned . &quot;
&quot; Do you mean to say that he deliberately tried to injure you ? &quot;
asked Mr. Damon .
&quot; Well , he may not have intended to hurt us , but that &apos;s what would have happened if I hadn &apos;t been able to throw her up into the wind when I did , &quot; replied Tom .
Then he told of Mr.
Swift having seen the red-haired bully near the aeroplane .
&quot; Andy may have only intended to put my machine out of working order , &quot; went on the young inventor , &quot; but it might have been worse than that , &quot; and he could not repress a shudder .
&quot; Are you going to say anything to him ? &quot;
asked Ned .
&quot; I certainly am ! &quot;
replied Torn quickly .
&quot; He doesn &apos;t realize that he might have crippled us both for life .
I sure am going to say something to him when I get back . &quot;
But Tom did not get the chance , for when he and Ned returned to Shopton , --the sky racer behaving beautifully on the homeward trip , --it was learned that Mr. Foger had suddenly left town , taking Andy with him .
&quot; Maybe he knew I &apos;d be after him , &quot; said Tom grimly , and so that incident was closed for the time being , but it was a long time before Tom and Ned got over their fright .
They had a nice visit with Mr. Damon , and talked of the city of gold to their heart &apos;s content , looking at several large maps of Mexico that the eccentric man had procured , and locating , as well as they could from the meager map and description they had , where the underground treasures might be .
&quot; I suppose you are getting ready to go , Mr.
Damon ? &quot;
remarked Ned .
&quot; Hush ! &quot;
cautioned the odd man , looking quickly around the room .
&quot; I haven &apos;t said anything to my wife about it yet .
You know she doesn &apos;t like me to go off on these &apos; wild goose chases &apos; as she calls them , with you , Tom Swift .
But bless my railroad ticket !
It &apos;s half the fun of my life . &quot;
&quot; Then don &apos;t you think you can go ? &quot;
asked the young inventor eagerly , for he had formed a strong like for Mr. Damon , and would very much regret to go without him .
&quot; Oh , bless my necktie !
I think I &apos;ll be able to manage it , &quot; was the answer .
&quot; I &apos;m not going to tell her anything about it until the last minute , and then I &apos;ll promise to bring her back one of the golden images .
She won &apos;t object then . &quot;
&quot; Good ! &quot;
exclaimed Tom .
&quot; I hope we can all bring back some of the images . &quot;
&quot; Yes , I know who you &apos;ll bring one for , &quot; said Ned with a laugh , and he took care to get beyond the reach of Tom &apos;s fist .
&quot; Her first name is Mary , &quot; he added .
&quot; You get out ! &quot;
laughed Tom , blushing at the same time .
&quot; Ah !
What a thing it is to be young ! &quot;
exclaimed Mr. Damon with a mock sigh .
The boys laughed , for the old man , though well along in years , was a boy at heart .
They talked at some length , speculating when they might hear from Mr. Illingway , and discussing the sort of an outfit that would be best to take with them .
Then , as the afternoon was drawing to a close , Tom and Ned went back in the aeroplane , hearing the news about the Fogers as I have previously mentioned .
&quot; Well , I &apos;ll have to wait until I do see Andy to take it out of his hide , &quot; remarked Tom grimly .
&quot; I &apos;m glad he &apos;s out of the way , though .
There won &apos;t be any more danger of his overhearing our plans , and I can work in peace on the dirigible balloon . &quot;
Though Tom had many air crafts , the one he thought best suited to take with them on their search for the city of gold would have to be constructed from parts of several machines , and it would take some time .
Tom began work on it the next day , his father helping him , as did Mr. Damon and Ned occasionally .
Several weeks were spent in this way , meanwhile the mails being anxiously watched for news from Africa .
&quot; Here you are , Tom ! &quot;
called the postman one morning , as he walked out to the shop where the young inventor was busy over the balloon .
&quot; Here &apos;s another letter from that Buggy-wuggy place . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you mean Gumba Twamba , in Africa ! &quot;
laughed the lad .
&quot; Good !
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been waiting for .
Now to see what the missionary says . &quot;
&quot; I hope you &apos;re not going to go as a missionary to Africa , Tom , &quot; said the postman .
&quot; No danger .
This is just a letter from a friend there .
He sent me some facts so I can go off on another expedition . &quot;
&quot; Oh , you &apos;re always going off on wild adventures , &quot; commented Uncle Sam &apos;s messenger with a shake of his head as he hurried away , while Tom tore open the letter from Africa and eagerly read it .
CHAPTER VI &quot; BEWARE THE HEAD-HUNTERS ! &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s what I want ! &quot;
exclaimed the young inventor , as he finished the perusal of the missionary &apos;s missive .
&quot; What is it ? &quot;
asked Mr.
Swift , entering the shop at that moment .
&quot; News from Africa , dad .
Mr. Illingway went to a lot of trouble to get more information for us about the city of gold , and he sends a better map .
It seems there was one among the effects of the white man who died near where Mr. Illingway has his mission .
With this map , and what additional information I have , we ought to locate the underground city .
Look , dad , &quot; and the lad showed the map .
&quot; Humph ! &quot;
exclaimed Mr.
Swift with a smile .
&quot; I don &apos;t call that a very clear map .
It shows a part of Central Mexico , that &apos;s true , but it &apos;s on such a small scale I don &apos;t see how you &apos;re going to tell anything by it . &quot;
&quot; But I have a description , &quot; explained Tom .
&quot; It seems according to Mr. Illingway &apos;s letter , that you have to go to the coast and strike into the interior until you are near the old city of Poltec .
That used to be it &apos;s name , but Mr. Illingway says it may be abandoned now , or the name changed .
But I guess we can find it . &quot;
&quot; Then , according to what he could learn from the African natives , who talked with the white man , the best way is to hire ox carts and strike into the jungle .
That &apos;s the only way to carry our baggage , and the dirigible balloon which I &apos;m going to take along . &quot;
&quot; Pretty uncertain way to look for a buried city of gold , &quot; commented Mr.
Swift .
&quot; But I suppose even if you don &apos;t find it you &apos;ll have the fun of searching for it , Tom . &quot;
&quot; But we ARE going to find it ! &quot;
the lad declared .
&quot; We &apos;ll get there , you &apos;ll see ! &quot;
&quot; But how are you going to know it when you see it ? &quot;
asked his father .
&quot; If it &apos;s underground even a balloon won &apos;t help you much . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s true it is underground , &quot; agreed Tom , &quot; but there must be an entrance to it somewhere , and I &apos;m going to hunt for that entrance .
Mr. Illingway writes that the city is a very old one , and was built underground by the priests of some people allied to the Aztecs .
They wanted a refuge in times of war and they also hid their valuables there .
They must have been rich to have so much gold , or else they didn &apos;t value it as we do . &quot;
&quot; That might be so , &quot; assented Mr.
Swift .
&quot; But I still maintain , Tom , that it &apos;s like looking for a needle in a haystack . &quot;
&quot; Still , I &apos;m going to have a try for it , &quot; asserted the lad .
&quot; If I can once locate the plain of the big temple I &apos;ll be near the entrance to the underground city . &quot;
&quot; What is the &apos; plain of the big temple , &apos; Tom ? &quot;
&quot; Mr. Illingway writes , &quot; said the lad , again referring to the letter , &quot; that somewhere near the beginning of the tunnel that leads into the city of gold , there is an immense flat plain , on which the ancient Aztecs once built a great temple .
Maybe they worshiped the golden images there .
Anyhow the temple is in ruins now , near an overgrown jungle , according to the stories the white man used to tell .
He once got as near the city of gold as the big temple , but hostile natives drove him and his party back .
Then he went to Africa after getting an image from someone , and died there .
So no one since has ever found the city of gold . &quot;
